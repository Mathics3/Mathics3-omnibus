8.0.0
-----

Jan 28, 2025

* Synchronize version number up with major API release in Mathics Kernel
* Add `dmathics3-tokens` interface to `mathics3-tokens` (from mathics-scanner)
* Use newer versions of everything, Ubuntu, Python, SymPy, etc.
* Remove lots of copies of old wheels from source; we can now get everything resonably fast from inside docker


4.0.1
-----

Front-end Scripts to run docker have been gone over to provide help via `--help`, and set environment variables that allow persistance of session by saving data on the host filesystem.

Docker images now include a version of Asymptote that will build images used in the manual, especially those that use Plot option `Filling` and `Bottom`.

Examples from Mark S Gockenbach's Tutorial for Partial Differential quations: Analytical and Numerical Methods have been added to the Mathics-Django worksheet database.

A bug was fixed in detecting the background use in `dmathicsscript`.

4.0.0
-----

# PyPI

Revised for Mathics 4.0.0. See the respective changes in Mathics3, Mathics-Django, and mathicsscript for changes there.

# Docker


* we now use `llvm12` and a more recent `gv`
* there is an `--upgrade` command added to all docker scripts to retrieve/updagte to the latest version
* More environment variables can be passed through.
* You can set environment variable `APP_DATADIR` to a directory outside Django to have data persist there. You may want to use this with `MATHIC_DJANGO_PATH` below...
* In `dmathicsscript`, if you set `MATHICS_DJANGO_DB_PATH` and that file doesn't exist, the system database will be copied to that location. This gives a way for persisting sessions outside of docker.

There is be interaction between `MATHICS_DJANGO_DB_PATH` and `APP_DATADIR` to get the database to persist.

As a simple example, run:

```
  $ MATHICS_DJANGO_DB_PATH=/usr/src/app/data/foo.sqlite dmathicsserver
```

Above, since by default `APP_DATADIR` maps `/usr/src/app/data` to `/tmp`, on the host filesystem in `/tmp/mathics-django.sqlite` workspace sessions can be saved.

3.1.0
-----

This version builds the PDF and stores that in the docker container. As a result two new
command and front-end shell scripts were added:

* `dmathicsdoc` will run _evince_ over the Mathics book that was built when the container was built.
* `dmathicsdoccopy` will copy the Mathics book that was built when the container was built.

The script for going into `mathicsscript` has been enhanced to try to detect the terminal background.

Set environment variable `COLORFGBG` to force what kind of background you have Use value `15;0` for dark backgrounds and `0;15` for light backgrounds.

Two new workspaces taken from "Implementing Discrete Mathematics" have been added to Mathics Django:

* C 3.1 Datastructures for Graphs
* C 3.2 Classifying Simple Graphs

Section 14: Coordinates and Graphics 3D has been revised now that the efficiency of threejs rendering has been improved. We can now easily compute 10x10 points in a box.
